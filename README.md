# Story
In a remarkable journey of determination and innovation, my friend and I participated in a prestigious robotics competition at the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology in Tunis. What makes this story extraordinary is that we were just 16 years old, competing against engineers and robotics enthusiasts. Our participation not only showcased our passion for robotics but also our commitment to pushing boundaries and defying expectations.

# What
Our project for the robotics competition involved the design and development of two robots:

RC Controlled Robot: We created a remote-controlled robot, capable of performing various tasks and challenges as directed by the competition guidelines.

Fully Autonomous Robot: In addition to the RC controlled robot, we designed and built a fully autonomous robot. This robot could execute tasks without human intervention, relying on programmed algorithms and sensors.

# How
Design and Construction: We designed and constructed both robots with meticulous attention to detail, ensuring they met the competition requirements and standards.

Programming: Extensive programming was involved in creating the fully autonomous robot, incorporating algorithms to enable it to navigate, sense its environment, and perform tasks autonomously.

Teamwork: Effective collaboration between my friend and me was key to the project's success. We divided tasks and worked cohesively to bring our robots to life.

# Challenges
Age Barrier: Participating in a competition intended for engineers and experts at the age of 16 was a daunting challenge. We faced skepticism and doubt due to our young age, but it only fueled our determination to prove ourselves.

Technical Complexity: Designing and building robots with both RC control and full autonomy required a deep understanding of robotics, electronics, and programming. We had to overcome various technical challenges along the way.

# Result
Our participation in the robotics competition was a remarkable achievement. Despite the initial skepticism and challenges, we reached the semi-finals, surpassing the expectations of many. This experience not only strengthened our passion for robotics but also showcased our ability to excel in a field typically reserved for more experienced individuals.
